/**
 * Lets the model put a decision back to the user instead of guessing. The interaction bar renders
 * the question and the answer returns here.
 *
 * A blocking call suspends until the user answers or skips, so the answer is part of this tool
 * result and the model never has to guess what was chosen. There is no timeout; the user decides
 * when the question is answered, and stopping the generation is what ends an unwanted wait.
 *
 * A non-blocking call returns as soon as the question is on screen and the model keeps working. The
 * answer then arrives as a queued user message, so it needs a conversation to arrive in.
 *
 * One call can carry several questions. They all reach the bar at once and are answered in any
 * order, which is what makes a small set of related decisions one interruption instead of several.
 *
 * Options are optional: a question without them is answered by typing.
